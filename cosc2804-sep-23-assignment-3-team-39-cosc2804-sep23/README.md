## Enhancements: ##
Enhancements can be accessed from the main menu through 'Enhancements Menu' (option number 4). After going into the enhancements menu, entering 1 will perform enhancement 1, entering 2 will perform enhancement 2 and entering 3 will go back to the main menu.

## Contributions: ##
### Shreyas Shah ### 
- Worked on main menu navigation including enhancements menu.
- Worked on user input validation with main menu, generate maze menu and solve maze menu, ensuring everything follows the c++ style guide. 
- Worked on the code for generating the maze from the terminal while using a data structurer for holding maze and generating a random maze using the recursive backtracking algorithm.
- Worked on flattening the terrain, building the maze in Minecraft and undoing modifications to the world while making the function as memory and computationally efficient as possible.
- Added black box test cases for the main menu, generating the maze, building the maze and restoring the terrain. 

### Harrison Orosz ###
- Created first draft for the recursive backtracking maze generation algorithm in another project folder.
- Implemented BFS algorithm to find the shortest possible solution for enhancement 2.
- Created Node class and header files used for storage solving data.
- Contributed some of the black box tests for enhancement 2.

### Leo Park ###
- Worked on Enhancement menu and error handling of main menu.
- Added black box test cases to generate random maze, manual maze input, displaying team information and enhancement 1.
- Completed manual solve and error handling of manual solve.
- ** Completed generating maze without flattening terrain while also accounting for obstacles for enhancement 1.

### Daniel Lienert ###
- worked on solving the maze manually and implementing the wall-follower algorithm to show path to exit.
- Added black box test cases for solving the maze.
- bug fixed / added missing features.
